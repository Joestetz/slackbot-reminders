          Slackbot is <a href="http://slack.com" target="_blank">Slack</a>'s built-in robot. 
          A key capability offered by Slackbot is to remotely post to a 
          team's channels via HTTP POST. To read more about it, you can visit 
          <a href="https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202026038-Slackbot-your-setup-assistant-personal-notepad-and-programmable-bot" target="_blank">

      <h2 class="page-header">How do I use this tool?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The sole purpose of this tool is to configure automatic messages for your 
          team's channel(s). Currently supported are one-time messages based on a date 
          and time and repeating messages on a given day of the week at a specific time.
        </p>

          To get started, you will need to enable the slackbot integration on your site. 
          Once enabled, there will be a token available specifically for this integration 
          that you will need to copy and paste into the home screen of this site. You will
          also need your team name (subdomain of your URL such as <em>https://<strong>SUBDOMAIN</strong>.slack.com</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we have those two bits of information, you can manage your existing team 
          reminders and create new ones.
